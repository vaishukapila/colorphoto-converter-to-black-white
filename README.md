# colorphoto-converter-to-black-whitephoto

I built a simple Streamlit web app that converts color images into black and white (grayscale) images. The app allows the user to upload an image in formats like PNG, JPG, or JPEG, and it instantly displays the original image. After that, it processes the image using the Pillow (PIL) library and converts it into a black-and-white version, which is also shown on the screen.

The main goal of this project is to provide an easy and interactive way to transform colorful photos into grayscale, which can be useful for photography, printing, or artistic effects. The app is lightweight, user-friendly, and runs directly in the browser without needing any complex setup.
